# Movie Database Backend Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to our Movie Database Backend project! In this project, we're developing a backend application that will serve as the foundation for our movie database. Our goal is to create a platform where users can interact with a wide variety of movies, rate them, and explore based on their interests.

## Key Features

### User Management

We will provide a user-friendly interface for users to register and manage their accounts. Users will have the ability to specify their interests, allowing us to personalize their movie recommendations.

### Movie Management

Our platform will host a vast collection of movies. Each movie will have its own page with detailed information such as title, release date, description, and genre. Users can explore the entire movie database and discover new films.

### Rating Functionality

Users will have the ability to rate movies on a scale, helping us gauge the popularity and quality of each film in our database. This interactive feature not only allows users to express their opinions but also influences how movies are presented and recommended to others.

### Functionalities

- **Get all movies**: Users can access a comprehensive list of all available movies.
- **Filter by genre**: Users can narrow down their search by selecting specific genres of interest.
- **Rate a movie**: Users can rate a movie, providing feedback on their experience and contributing to the overall rating of the film.
- **Sort by rating**: Users can view movies ranked by user ratings, helping them discover popular and highly-rated films.

## Additional Functionality

In addition to the core features mentioned above, we will provide additional functionality to enhance the user experience:
- **Interest specification**: Users can specify their interests during account setup or update them later. This information will be used to tailor movie searches and improve user engagement.

### Note:

For testing the endpoints, no frontend is required. Postman or any API testing tool is sufficient to interact with our backend API.

This assignment aims to assess your backend development skills using Nest.JS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, TypeORM, and understanding of the hexagonal architecture pattern. Should you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the assignment, feel free to reach out for assistance.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
